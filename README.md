# Educational Dashboard | Test Task

## How to start the application:

For your convenience, I have also hosted both applications online:
- Frontend: [edfront.zzz.com.ua](https://edfront.zzz.com.ua)
- Backend: [edapi.zzz.com.ua](https://edapi.zzz.com.ua)

To start the application locally:

Please make sure to include a .env file with a variable called:
``` VITE_API_URL``` which contains the backend API URL.

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
